/// A view-model is a helper object to a [StoreConnector] widget. It holds the
/// part of the Store state the corresponding dumb-widget needs, and may also
/// convert this state part into a more convenient format for the dumb-widget
/// to work with.
///
/// You must implement equals/hashcode for the view-model class to work.
/// Otherwise, the [StoreConnector] will think the view-model changed everytime,
/// and thus will rebuild everytime. This won't create any visible problems
/// to your app, but is inefficient and may be slow.
///
/// By extending the [Vm] class you can implement equals/hashcode without
/// having to override these methods. Instead, simply list all fields
/// (which are not immutable, like functions) to the [equals] parameter
/// in the constructor.
